\textbf{Abstract—The paper considers the principles of decentralized problem solving within the ecosystem of nextgeneration intelligent computer systems, in particular, the architecture of such an ecosystem is considered from the
point of view of organizing the process of problem solving,
the roles of systems involved in the process of problem
solving are separated. The principles of forming a collective of systems involved in problem solving, the stages of solving a particular problem by the resulting collective are specified.

   \textbf{I. Introduction} 
\end{center} 


Currently, one of the key trends in the field of intelligent technologies is the so-called decentralized artificial
intelligence [1], [2]. This trend is caused, on the one hand,
by the development and widespread use of autonomous
mobile devices (both self-sufficient and as part of more
complex systems, as in the case of various kinds of
sensors), which interact intensively when solving tasks
together, which, in particular, led to the emergence and
development of such a trend as the Internet of Things.
On the other hand, decentralization is necessary when
solving problems of complex automation of various
processes, for example, production. In this case, the
implementation of an automation system with a monolithic centralized architecture becomes impossible, in this
regard, the task of integrating a variety of heterogeneous
devices and subsystems into a single information space,
within which various models and methods of artificial
intelligence are subsequently applied. There is a large
number of studies aimed at developing the principles
of problem solving in distributed teams of interacting
computer systems [1]–[3].

 In turn, the complex automation of various human
activities and the development of corresponding complex
intelligent systems of automation leads to the need to
integrate within such systems different types of knowledge and different problem solving models and to ensure
the possibility of joint use of these models in solving
complex problems [4], [5]. In addition, the problem of
reducing the labor intensity of not only the development
of such systems, but also their evolution and maintenance
at all stages of the life cycle is relevant. The solution of
the mentioned problem becomes possible when providing
syntactic and semantic compatibility of models of representation of different types of knowledge and different
problem solving models. In other words, to solve the
problem of complex automation of human activity, it is
necessary to provide convergence of different models of
representation and information processing in intelligent
systems.

At the same time, as it has already been noted, an important trend in the development of artificial intelligence
technologies is the desire to decentralize the solution of
various problems, in connection with which the creation
of next-generation intelligent computer systems with a
high level of interoperability is increasingly relevant.
In this case, by interoperability [6] is meant not just
ensuring compatibility of systems at the level of technical

implementation (coordination of interaction protocols,
program interfaces, etc.), but ensuring their semantic
compatibility and ability to collectively solve complex
problems. This implies a significant development and
increase in the level of formalization of the theory of
intelligent computer systems, rethinking of the existing
technologies of their development and maintenance in the
context of ensuring their convergence, and ultimately –
the creation of a comprehensive technology of designing
intelligent computer systems of a new generation, taking
into account the need to develop not only individual intelligent computer systems, but also decentralized collectives of such
